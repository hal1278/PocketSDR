# Web UI Design (sdr_web, pocket_web)

Date: 2026-08-08

----

## Summary

This note describes the design of the PocketSDR Web UI. The receiver AP
`pocket_web` embeds a small HTTP + WebSocket server implemented in
`src/sdr_web.c` (part of libsdr). The Web UI itself is a static
single-page application (plain JavaScript + CSS, no framework, no build step)
served by that server. The browser communicates with the AP over a single
WebSocket connection: JSON text messages for commands and low-rate status,
binary frames for high-rate bulk data (PSD, correlator snapshot, correlator
history). PSD and correlator history views update at 10 Hz.

The goal is functional parity with the desktop GUI `python/pocket_sdr.py`,
monitoring and receiver control alike.

The feature was first developed inside `pocket_trk` and split off as the
separate AP `pocket_web` once the receiver lifecycle moved to the browser:
the two APs then wanted opposite command lines, `pocket_trk` a full one and
the server almost none. `pocket_trk` is back to the CLI receiver it was.

## Requirements

1. `pocket_trk` itself hosts the web server and the command / monitor-data
   exchange for the Web UI.
2. The Web UI is JS + CSS. Transport is WebSocket; bulk data uses binary
   frames.
3. The UI eventually reproduces `python/pocket_sdr.py`; the first version may
   provide only basic screens.
4. The PSD and correlator-history screens update at 10 Hz.
5. The server-side UI support is new code in `src/sdr_web.c`.

Requirement 1 is met by `pocket_web` rather than by `pocket_trk`; see the
Summary.

## Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

- Zero new external dependencies. HTTP/1.1 (static files only) and the
  RFC 6455 WebSocket subset needed here are small enough to implement
  directly on BSD sockets / winsock2, in C99, matching the existing code
  style. SHA-1 and Base64 (WebSocket handshake only) are implemented as
  small static functions in `sdr_web.c`.
- Reuse the existing monitor/control API of `src/sdr_rcv.c` unchanged. The
  Python GUI already drives the receiver exclusively through
  `sdr_rcv_ch_stat()`, `sdr_rcv_corr_stat()`, `sdr_rcv_rfch_psd()` etc.;
  `sdr_web.c` only adds a transport + encoding layer on top of the same
  calls. No public API changes.
- Keep `pocket_trk` free of the Web UI. The server AP is separate, so the
  CLI receiver keeps its command line and its behavior.
- Receiver lifecycle from the browser: `pocket_web` starts with the receiver
  stopped and the browser configures, starts and stops it. The settings of
  the last session are restored at start and saved at exit.

Non-Goals (for now, see Future Extensions):

- Authentication and TLS. The server binds to 127.0.0.1 by default; remote
  use should go through a reverse proxy.

## Architecture

```

 | |  - 10 ms tick scheduler          |    |        +---------------------+
 | +----------------------------------+    |
 +-----------------------------------------+
```

One server thread handles everything (accept, HTTP, WebSocket I/O, periodic
sampling and push). All receiver access goes through the existing thread-safe
monitor API, so no new locking is required in the receiver core.

## Server Design (src/sdr_web.c)

### Public API

```c
/* pocket_sdr.h */
typedef struct sdr_web_tag sdr_web_t;

sdr_web_t *sdr_web_start(sdr_rcv_t *rcv, const char *addr, int port,
    const char *html_dir);
void sdr_web_init_cfg(sdr_web_cfg_t *cfg);
void sdr_web_set_cfg(sdr_web_t *web, const sdr_web_cfg_t *cfg,
    const char *file);
int sdr_web_load_cfg(sdr_web_t *web);
int sdr_web_start_rcv(sdr_web_t *web);
sdr_rcv_t *sdr_web_stop(sdr_web_t *web);
```

- `sdr_web_start()` binds `addr:port` (TCP, `SO_REUSEADDR`), starts the server
  thread (`sdr_thread_create()`), and returns an opaque handle. NULL on error.
  `rcv` may be NULL: the server then starts with no receiver.
- `sdr_web_init_cfg()` fills a `sdr_web_cfg_t` with the defaults used on the
  first start without a settings file.
- `sdr_web_set_cfg()` hands the configuration to the server and enables the
  lifecycle and configuration commands. Without it the server is monitor-only.
  `file` is the settings file, saved when the receiver stops and when the
  server stops.
- `sdr_web_load_cfg()` restores the configuration and the system options from
  that file.
- `sdr_web_start_rcv()` starts the receiver from the stored configuration, as
  the Start command does, for the `-start` option of `pocket_web`.
- `sdr_web_stop()` signals the thread, closes all sockets, joins and frees.
  The current receiver is not closed; it is returned to the caller.
- Winsock is initialized by `sdr_func_init()` -> `strinitcom()`, which
  `pocket_web` calls before starting the server, and `-lws2_32` / `-lwsock32`
  are already linked; no build-level changes beyond adding the object file.

### Thread model

Single server thread, `select()` based event loop with a 10 ms timeout that
doubles as the scheduler tick:

1. `select()` on the listen socket + client sockets (read set; write set only
   for clients with pending output).
2. Accept new connections (up to `MAX_WEB_CLI = 8`, else 503/close).
3. Read and parse per client: HTTP request until upgrade, WebSocket frames
   after upgrade.
4. On each tick, for every (client, topic) subscription whose period elapsed
   (`sdr_get_tick()`), sample the receiver, encode, and send.

Per-client threads are avoided deliberately: client count is small, payloads
are small, and a single thread makes the subscription state trivially
consistent.

### HTTP server

Static file serving only, enough for the UI to be self-hosted:

- `GET` only; anything else 405. Request line + headers capped at 4 KB.
- `/` maps to `index.html`. Paths are resolved under `html_dir`; any path
  containing `..` is rejected (403).
- Content types by extension: html, css, js, mjs, png, svg, ico, json, woff2.
- `Connection: close` after each response (the only long-lived connection is
  the WebSocket). No caching headers in v1 (dev-friendly).
- Default `html_dir` is `<exe_dir>/../html` (exe dir via `GetModuleFileName` /
  `/proc/self/exe` / `_NSGetExecutablePath`), falling back to `./html`;
  overridable by the `-html` option.

### WebSocket implementation

Endpoint `GET /ws` with `Upgrade: websocket`. RFC 6455 subset:

- Handshake: `Sec-WebSocket-Accept = base64(sha1(key + RFC6455-GUID))`.
- Opcodes: 0x1 text, 0x2 binary, 0x8 close, 0x9 ping, 0xA pong. Client
  frames are masked (required), server frames unmasked.
- Client-to-server messages are commands only and are capped at 4 KB
  (fragmented messages are assembled up to that cap, then the client is
  dropped). Server-to-client frames are never fragmented.
- Keepalive: server pings every 10 s, drops a client after 30 s without pong.

### Subscription model and scheduler

Each client holds a small table of active subscriptions:

```c
typedef struct {
    int topic;              /* WEB_TOPIC_??? */
    int cyc;                /* update cycle (ms), clamped to >= 50 */
    uint32_t next;          /* next due tick (ms) */
    double prm[4];          /* topic parameters (tave, tspan, width, ...) */
    int ch, rfch;           /* target channels */
    char sys[16], sats[256];/* text parameters */
} web_sub_t;
```

- `sub` creates or replaces the subscription for that topic (re-`sub` with
  new parameters is the way to change them).
- `unsub` removes it. All subscriptions die with the connection.
- `get` performs a one-shot sample of a topic without subscribing.
- The scheduler skips (does not queue) a topic push while more than 32 KB is
  still pending for that client: latest-data-wins, no unbounded queues. Send is
  non-blocking with a 256 KB per-client output buffer; a client that stays
  blocked past that is dropped.

### Monitor topics

Topics map 1:1 onto existing monitor calls. Text-producing APIs are passed
through verbatim inside JSON; the JS side ports the column parsing that
`pocket_sdr.py` already does. This keeps the C side thin, at the cost of
making the existing status formats part of the wire protocol (acceptable —
they are already the de-facto GUI API).

| topic       | source API                                   | payload  | default cyc |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `rcv_stat`  | `sdr_rcv_rcv_stat()` + `sdr_rcv_str_stat()` + CPU load | JSON | 200 ms |
| `ch_stat`   | `sdr_rcv_ch_stat()` (sys/chno/min_lock/rfch/opt from sub) | JSON | 200 ms |
| `sat_stat`  | `sdr_rcv_sat_stat()` per sat in `sats` param | JSON     | 200 ms      |
| `pvt_sol`   | `sdr_rcv_pvt_sol()`                          | JSON     | 200 ms      |
| `rfch_stat` | `sdr_rcv_rfch_stat()` all RF+array CHs       | JSON     | 200 ms      |
| `hist`      | `sdr_rcv_rfch_hist()`                        | JSON     | 200 ms      |
| `log`       | `sdr_get_log()` (server-side fan-out)        | JSON     | 200 ms      |
| `array_stat`| `sdr_rcv_array_stat()` + beams + ant_pos     | JSON     | 500 ms      |
| `opts`      | current `sdr_rcv_setopt()` option values     | JSON     | 200 ms      |
| `cfg`       | receiver configuration (`sdr_web_cfg_t`)     | JSON     | on get      |
| `psd`       | `sdr_rcv_rfch_psd()` (rfch 0: all RF CHs)    | binary 1 | 100 ms      |
| `corr`      | `sdr_rcv_corr_stat()`                        | binary 2 | 100 ms      |
| `corr_hist` | `sdr_rcv_corr_hist()`                        | binary 3 | 100 ms      |
| `spatial`   | `sdr_spatial_get()`                         | binary 4 | 250 ms      |

Notes:

- `ch_stat` needs a large buffer: 128 B x `SDR_MAX_NCH` (1500) = 192 KB,
  allocated once in `sdr_web_t` (`sdr_malloc()`), same sizing as the Python
  GUI, not the small static buffer the console status display of `pocket_trk`
  uses.
- `rcv_stat` carries the process CPU load in `cpu`, measured by the server
  thread once a second from the process CPU time (`GetProcessTimes()` on
  Windows, `getrusage()` elsewhere) over the elapsed wall time, divided by the
  number of cores. 100 % therefore means every core is saturated, so the value
  answers "does this machine keep up?" rather than "how busy is one core?".
  It is measured once and shared, so all clients see the same value.
- `rcv_stat` also carries the per-stream status in `strs` (-1: error, 0: close,
  1: wait, 2: connect, 3: active) as the Receiver page LEDs. -1 covers an
  output stream that failed to open, which stays in the slot as a status
  carrier without a stream (`sdr_rcv_str_stat()`).
- `psd` samples `sdr_rcv_rfch_psd(rcv, ch, tave, nfft, psd)` with `tave` and
  `nfft` (default 2048) from the subscription; returns N/2 bins for I
  sampling, N for IQ.
- `corr_hist` samples `sdr_rcv_corr_hist(rcv, ch, tspan, stat, P)`;
  n = min(tspan/T, 5000) points.
- 10 Hz for `psd`/`corr`/`corr_hist` satisfies requirement (4); `cyc` is
  clamped to >= 50 ms so a client cannot exceed the Python GUI's UD_CYCLE1.
- The `default cyc` column is what the Web UI subscribes with. A `sub` that
  omits `cyc` falls back to 100 ms for the JSON topics and 50 ms for the
  binary ones.

Receiver lifecycle commands (enabled when the AP passes its configuration via
`sdr_web_set_cfg()`; the flat values mirror the `sdr_web_cfg_t` fields, with
`fs`/`fo`/`lpf` in MHz and multi-value fields as comma-separated strings,
output paths separated by `|`):

| cmd        | arguments                                    | action     |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| `start`    | -                                            | open the receiver from the stored configuration |
| `stop`     | -                                            | close the running receiver (Web UI stays up) |
| `set_inp`  | `inp`, `file`, `fmt`, `fs`, `fo`, `IQ`, `bits`, `lpf`, `toff`, `tscale`, `bus`, `port`, `conf`, `conf_ena`, `dev_opt`, `driver` | update input configuration |
| `set_sig`  | `sigs` ("SIG:prns ..."), `rfch`              | update signal configuration |
| `set_out`  | `types`, `paths`, `log_mask`, `array_sep`    | update output streams |
| `set_sys`  | `fftw`, `opt`, `fast_acq`                    | update system configuration |
| `opts_default` | -                                        | restore the default system options |

`set_*` are rejected while the receiver runs. On `start`/`stop` the server
broadcasts an updated `hello` (with `run` and `cfg_ena` flags) to all clients.
The AP stays up when a file input ends or when an open fails; it goes idle
until started again from the Web UI.

Options that the receiver takes as tokens of its options string but the UI
presents as their own controls -- the digital LPF bandwidths, the fast
acquisition mode and the RF CH separation -- are configuration fields of
their own (`lpf_bw[]`, `fast_acq`, `array_sep`) and are composed into the
options string when the receiver is opened. The Receiver Options text stays
as the user typed it instead of gaining and losing `-LPF=` / `-FAST_SRCH` /
`-ARRAY` tokens behind their back. The RF frontend device options
(`-GAIN=` / `-BW=`) are a separate field (`dev_opt`) as in the Tk GUI, and
the device configuration file has an enable flag (`conf_ena`) so that its
path survives being switched off.

Every command is answered with an `ack` JSON message. `setopt` accepts only
the key names already handled by `sdr_rcv_setopt()`.

### Correlator-channel selection policy

`sdr_rcv_sel_ch()` enables the `SDR_N_CORRX` (101) extra correlators on
exactly one channel and disables them elsewhere, so it is a global,
contended resource:

- The server owns a single "selected channel" state; a `corr`/`corr_hist`
  subscription (or explicit `sel_ch` command) sets it, last-writer-wins.
- Every change is broadcast to all clients as `{"type":"sel_ch",...}` so
  their Correlator pages can follow.
- When no client subscribes `corr`/`corr_hist`, the server calls
  `sdr_rcv_sel_ch(rcv, 0, 3e-6)` to disable the extra correlators — the same
  load-shedding the Python GUI performs when the Correlator page is hidden.

### Log topic

`sdr_get_log()` is a destructive read (the 512 KB accumulation buffer is
cleared on read), so it must have a single consumer. The server thread polls
it every 200 ms into an internal ring of 2000 lines (like the GUI's
`MAX_RCVLOG`) and pushes the increments to all subscribed clients. The `-log`
output streams are unaffected (they are fed via `sdr_log_add_str()`, a
separate path). A newly connected client receives the current ring content
once, then increments.

### Locking and thread safety

- All receiver reads go through the monitor API, which either takes the
  appropriate mutex internally (`sdr_ch_corr_stat/hist` -> `ch->mtx`,
  `sdr_pvt_solstr` -> `pvt->mtx`) or does lock-free approximate reads
  (`sdr_rcv_ch_stat`), exactly as the Python GUI does today.
- Command APIs (`sdr_rcv_setopt`, `sdr_rcv_sel_ch`, gain/filter) are already
  called cross-thread by the GUI; same usage here.
- `sdr_web_t` state (clients, subscriptions, log ring) is owned by the server
  thread only; `sdr_web_stop()` synchronizes via a stop flag + thread join.

## Wire Protocol

Protocol version 1. All JSON is UTF-8 in WebSocket text frames; all binary
frames are little-endian (both supported hosts are LE).

### Session start

On WebSocket open the server sends:

```json
{"type":"hello","name":"Pocket SDR","ver":"0.20","proto":1,
 "nrfch":2,"narch":0,"nch":121,"fs":24000000.0,"sel_ch":0,
 "run":1,"cfg_ena":1}
```

### Client to server (JSON)

```json
{"cmd":"sub","topic":"psd","rfch":1,"cyc":100,"tave":0.01,"nfft":2048}
{"cmd":"sub","topic":"corr","ch":12,"cyc":100,"width":5e-6}
{"cmd":"sub","topic":"corr_hist","ch":12,"cyc":100,"tspan":1.0}
{"cmd":"sub","topic":"ch_stat","cyc":200,"sys":"ALL","chno":0,
 "min_lock":2.0,"rfch":0,"opt":1}
{"cmd":"sub","topic":"sat_stat","cyc":200,"sats":"G01,G05,J01"}
{"cmd":"unsub","topic":"psd"}
{"cmd":"get","topic":"rcv_stat"}
{"cmd":"sel_ch","ch":12,"width":5e-6}
{"cmd":"set_gain","rfch":1,"gain":-1}
{"cmd":"setopt","name":"el_mask","value":15.0}
```

Values are flat (string / number / bool); no nested objects or arrays are
required, which keeps the embedded JSON parser minimal (~100 lines).

### Server to client (JSON)

```json
{"type":"rcv_stat","str":"...one line...","strs":[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 "cpu":12.3}
{"type":"ch_stat","str":"header\ncolumns\nCH lines..."}
{"type":"pvt_sol","str":"2026-08-01 12:34:56.0 ..."}
{"type":"sat_stat","sats":[{"sat":"G01","az":123.4,"el":45.6,"pvt":1,
 "obs":1,"eph":1,"svh":0,"fcn":0}]}
{"type":"rfch_stat","chs":[{"ch":1,"dev":1,"fmt":2,"fs":24.0,"fo":1568.0,
 "IQ":2,"bits":2,"std":9.9,"rtoc":0}]}
{"type":"hist","rfch":1,"val":[-3,-1,1,3],"hist1":[...],"hist2":[...]}
{"type":"log","lines":["$POS,...","$CH,..."]}
{"type":"sel_ch","ch":12,"width":5e-6}
{"type":"ack","cmd":"set_gain","ok":true,"msg":""}
{"type":"error","msg":"..."}
```

### Binary frames

Common rule: byte 0 is the frame type. JS decodes with `DataView` /
`Float32Array`.

Type 1 — PSD (topic `psd`):

| offset | type   | field                                             |
|--------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | u8     | frame type = 1                                    |
| 1      | u8     | RF CH (1-origin)                                  |
| 2      | u8     | IQ (1:I, 2:IQ)                                    |
| 3      | u8     | bits                                              |
| 4      | f32    | fs (Hz)                                           |
| 8      | f32    | tave (s)                                          |
| 12     | u32    | n (PSD bins)                                      |
| 16     | f64    | fo (Hz)                                           |
| 24     | f32[n] | PSD (dB/Hz); I: [fo, fo+fs/2], IQ: [fo-fs/2, fo+fs/2], DC centered |

Type 2 — correlator snapshot (topic `corr`):

| offset  | type    | field                                            |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | u8      | frame type = 2                                   |
| 1       | u8      | state (1:IDLE, 2:SRCH, 3:LOCK)                   |
| 2       | u16     | BB CH number                                     |

Type 3 — P-correlator history (topic `corr_hist`):

| offset | type    | field                                             |

Size 24 + 8n; tspan = 1 s at T = 1 ms -> 1000 points -> 8 KB.

Type 4 — spatial heatmap (topic `spatial`):

| offset | type | field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | u8 | frame type = 4 |
| 1 | u8 | algorithm ID (1: Bartlett) |
| 2 | u16 | selected BB CH |
| 4 | u32 | map sequence |
| 8 | f64 | receiver time (s) |
| 16 | f32 | selected signal C/N0 (dB-Hz) |
| 20 | u16 | azimuth cell count |
| 22 | u16 | elevation cell count |
| 24 | f32 | first azimuth (deg) |
| 28 | f32 | first elevation (deg) |
| 32 | f32 | azimuth step (deg) |
| 36 | f32 | elevation step (deg) |
| 40 | f32[naz * nel] | linear power, elevation rows with azimuth varying fastest |

The default map is 72 by 19 cells, 5° steps, and approximately 5 updates/s.
The page displays each cell relative to the current map maximum over a fixed
25 dB color range. The array geometry file path is stored as `geom` in the
Web UI settings and reloaded when the receiver starts.

## Web UI App (html/)

### Files

```
html/
  index.html
  css/style.css
  js/main.js        app shell: tabs, button bar, status bar
  js/ws.js          WebSocket client: reconnect, sub/unsub bookkeeping,
                    JSON dispatch, binary frame decode
  js/plot.js        Canvas-2D plot library (port of python/sdr_plot.py:
                    axes, 1-2-5 ticks, time axis, sky plot, markers)

  js/pages/sig.js   Signal Options page

  img/favicon.svg
```

The Options and Help pages have no tab; they are reached from the command
buttons in the title bar (Start, Stop, Input, Output, Signal, System, ?).

Plain ES modules, no framework, no bundler — the server serves the tree
as-is, matching the project's no-dependency policy. Layout uses CSS
grid/flexbox (the Tk `place(relx/relwidth)` layouts translate directly).

### Rendering

- Plots are Canvas 2D, one canvas per plot panel, redrawn on data arrival.
  10 Hz redraw of the three Correlator panels plus one PSD panel is far below
  Canvas limits; no requestAnimationFrame accumulation is needed, but a
  "latest frame only" guard drops stale frames if the tab is throttled.
- Only the visible page holds its subscriptions: switching tabs unsubscribes
  the old page's topics and subscribes the new page's (mirrors
  `pages_update()` updating only the current tab, and drives the sel_ch
  load-shedding policy server-side).
- Reconnect with exponential backoff; on reconnect the current page
  re-subscribes.

### Pages and phases

All four phases below are implemented.

Phase 1:

- **Shell**: title bar with receiver name/version (from `hello`), command
  buttons and a connection indicator that blinks at 1 Hz while the receiver
  runs (`run` of `hello`), tab bar, status bar (message +
  `CPU: xx.x %  Time: xxx s` from `rcv_stat`).
- **Receiver**: text status table (2 columns x 11 rows, same labels as
  `update_rcv_stat()`), output-stream LEDs, PVT solution line. No sky plot /
  C/N0 bar yet.
- **BB CH**: channel table from `ch_stat` (16 short-format columns, C/N0 bar
  drawn client-side 25-50 dB-Hz, idle/search row coloring, row click selects
  the Correlator channel).
- **RF CH**: single-CH view: PSD plot (10 Hz, Y fixed [-85, -45] dB/Hz,
  LO marker, signal frequency marks) + I/Q histograms (`hist` topic), Ave(s)
  selector; gain/filter selectors wired to `set_gain`/`set_filt`.
- **Correlator**: the three panels of `corr_page` at 10 Hz — correlator
  shape plot (I*sign(IP) etc. with IQ/W/T/Range selectors), IP-QP scatter
  (history), IP/QP time series with status text overlay; CH prev/next and
  selection synced via `sel_ch` broadcasts.
- **Log**: filter combo + free text (AND = space, OR = `|`), pause/clear,
  monospace scrollback (2000 lines).

Phase 2: Receiver page sky plot + signal C/N0 bar chart, RF CH "ALL"
frequency-band map and 2x2 PSD tiling, Satellites page, Solution page
(client-side solution ring like `sol_log`, Pos ENU / Horiz modes).

Phase 3: Array page (`array_*` topics/commands), System Options page
(`setopt`), gain heatmap overlay + beam setting on the sky plot.

Phase 4: receiver lifecycle from the browser — Start / Stop and the Input,
Output and Signal Options pages, laid out after the Tk dialogs, with the
settings saved to and restored from the AP settings file. This is what made
the server its own AP; see the Summary.

Responsive layout: the pages reflow below 620 px so a phone can drive the
receiver — the Receiver page stacks status, sky plot and C/N0 in thirds, the
RF CH page puts the PSD over the histograms, and the Correlator page stacks
its three panels.

### Visual style

Ported from the Tk GUI so both frontends look alike:

- Page background `#F0F0F0` / plot background `#FFFFFF`, frame and tick
  `#555555`, grid `#CCCCCC`, primary plot `#003020`, secondary `#888844`,
  reference `#BBBBBB`, warning `#FF4000`.
- Satellite system colors: G `#006600`, R `#EE9900`, E `#CC00CC`,
  J `#0000AA`, C `#CC0000`, I `#007777`, S `#777777` (+ pale variants).
- Fonts: `"DejaVu Sans", "Noto Sans", sans-serif` at 10px, 9px for tables and
  plot labels; tables and log in `"DejaVu Sans Mono", "Noto Sans Mono",
  monospace`. Numeric cells right-aligned.
- The theme is a set of `:root` custom properties in `css/style.css`; the plot
  library takes its fonts from there through `cssVar()` and keeps its colors
  as its own constants.
- Base layout 800x600, fully responsive via flex/grid.

## pocket_web AP

`app/pocket_web/pocket_web.c` is the whole AP, about 150 lines. It needs no
receiver-open code of its own: `sdr_web.c` builds the receiver from the
configuration.

```
pocket_web [-web [addr:]port] [-html dir] [-ini file] [-start]
           [-debug file] [-v]
```

```c
sdr_func_init("");                 /* also initializes the socket library */
web = sdr_web_start(NULL, addr, port, html_dir);
sdr_web_init_cfg(&cfg);
sdr_web_set_cfg(web, &cfg, ini_file);
sdr_web_load_cfg(web);             /* settings of the last session */
if (start) sdr_web_start_rcv(web); /* -start */
while (!intr) sdr_sleep_msec(100); /* lifecycle belongs to the browser */
rcv = sdr_web_stop(web);
if (rcv) sdr_rcv_close(rcv);
```

The AP prints no runtime status of its own; the receiver is monitored from
the Web UI. It stays up when the receiver fails to open, so the settings can
be fixed from the browser.

Shutdown matters here, because a session that dies without closing the
device leaves the RF frontend streaming. On Windows the C runtime raises
SIGINT only for Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break, while a console close, logoff or
shutdown terminates the process as soon as the handler returns, so the AP
installs a `SetConsoleCtrlHandler()` that waits for the main thread to close
the device (`pocket_trk` does the same). `run_sdr.sh` starts and stops the
server; on MSYS2 it stops it with SIGQUIT, which reaches a native Windows
process as CTRL_BREAK_EVENT, because plain `kill` is `TerminateProcess()`
and would leave the frontend streaming.

`doc/command_ref.md` documents the AP; `doc/api_ref.md` documents the
`sdr_web.c` API.

## Build Changes

- `lib/build/libsdr.mk`: add `sdr_web.o` to `OBJ`, plus its compile rule and
  the `pocket_sdr.h` dependency line (3 places).
- `src/pocket_sdr.h`: `sdr_web_t` opaque typedef, `sdr_web_cfg_t` and the
  prototypes.
- `app/pocket_web/makefile`: new, a copy of the `pocket_trk` one with a
  single target (links `libsdr.a`; `-lws2_32` is already present on Windows).
- `test/utest/makefile`: `test_sdr_web` exercises the server over a real
  loopback socket with a minimal HTTP/WS client — start/stop, static serving
  (200 / 404 / path traversal), the RFC 6455 handshake and `hello`, commands
  and `ack`, the configuration defaults and their round trip through the
  settings file, and `sdr_web_start_rcv()` — avoiding test-only hooks in the
  source.

## Performance Estimates

Per client, defaults (fs = 24 Msps, 100-CH receiver, tspan = 1 s):

| topic       | payload    | rate  | bandwidth  |
|-------------|------------|-------|------------|
| `psd`       | ~8.2 KB    | 10 Hz | ~82 KB/s   |
| `corr`      | ~2.2 KB    | 10 Hz | ~22 KB/s   |
| `corr_hist` | ~8 KB      | 10 Hz | ~80 KB/s   |
| `ch_stat`   | ~11 KB     | 5 Hz  | ~55 KB/s   |
| others      | < 2 KB     | 5 Hz  | ~10 KB/s   |

Roughly 0.25 MB/s per fully-subscribed client; 8 clients ~2 MB/s — no issue
on localhost or LAN.

CPU: one `sdr_rcv_rfch_psd()` call at tave = 0.01 copies 240 k samples and
runs ~117 x 2048-point FFTs; at 10 Hz this is a few ms/s of one core.
`corr_hist` is a 40 KB memcpy worst case. The extra-correlator cost is
bounded by the same sel_ch policy the Python GUI uses. Encoding is
memcpy-level. Total server overhead is negligible next to the receiver
itself, and the single-thread receive path requirement is untouched (the
web server runs on its own thread and only reads).

## Security Considerations

- Binds 127.0.0.1 when `-web` gives a port alone, so exposing the interface
  is an explicit act (`-web 0.0.0.0:port`). No warning is printed for it.
- No TLS/auth in scope; for remote access, front with a reverse proxy
  (nginx/caddy) providing HTTPS + auth. WSS works transparently through such
  a proxy.
- Path traversal blocked in the static file server; request size capped;
  client count capped; per-client output bounded (slow clients dropped).
- Commands can change receiver behavior (`setopt`, gain, filter) — another
  reason the default bind is loopback-only.

## Future Extensions

- Embedding the `html/` tree into the binary (generated C arrays) for a
  single-file distribution; `-html` would then switch to disk for
  development.
- Array control page and calibration monitor.
- Optional `Origin` check on the WebSocket handshake.

## Implementation Milestones

1. `sdr_web.c` core: socket loop, HTTP static serving, WebSocket handshake +
   framing, JSON command parser, `hello`/`ack` (verifiable with a browser
   console or `wscat` alone).
2. JSON monitor topics (`rcv_stat`, `ch_stat`, `pvt_sol`, `sat_stat`,
   `rfch_stat`, `hist`, `log`) + scheduler.
3. Binary topics (`psd`, `corr`, `corr_hist`) + sel_ch policy.
4. `html/` phase-1 UI: shell, plot.js, Receiver / BB CH / RF CH /
   Correlator / Log pages.
5. Commands (`set_gain`, `set_filt`, `setopt`, `log_level`), AP options,
   `doc/command_ref.md` update.
6. Phase-2 pages (sky plot, C/N0 bars, band map, Satellites, Solution).
7. Phase-3 Array page and System Options page.
8. Phase-4 receiver lifecycle and the Input / Output / Signal Options pages,
   settings save and restore.
9. Split the server off as the `pocket_web` AP and revert `pocket_trk`.
